/**
 * sync-skills.ts — Pure functions for the skill auto-sync flow.
 *
 * Extracted from index.ts so they can be unit-tested without spinning up
 * the Pi extension runtime (and without mocking homedir / git).
 *
 * The sync flow (see `syncSkillsFromClone` in index.ts):
 *   1. Read git HEAD hash from the cloned project.
 *   2. If unchanged since last sync (marker file), no-op.
 *   3. Else: mirror active project skills → ~/.agents/skills/,
 *      and remove any local skill that is NOT active AND NOT retired.
 *
 * The "retired" allow-list is the user-facing knob: a skill listed in
 * skills/stelow/retired-skills.yaml is preserved across
 * syncs even though it is no longer in the project, so its stale copy
 * on the user's machine can be cleaned up by future releases (or by
 * the same release, if combined with a delete).
