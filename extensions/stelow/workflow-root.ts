/**
 * workflow-root.ts — Single source of truth for "what worktree does this cwd
 * belong to?" across the stelow extension, the muxy panel, and the herdr
 * split-pane TUI.
 *
 * History: the extension used to climb up to a parent directory whenever the
 * cwd had no `stelow.json` of its own. This was meant to handle "user is
 * inside src/ but tracking is at repo root". In practice, it caused a real
 * bug: when a user runs /sw-start in /Users/cali/Development/PROJECT-X
 * (which has no .stelow), the resolver climbed up to /Users/cali/Development
 * (which DID have .stelow from a previous workflow) and falsely reported an
 * active workflow, blocking /sw-start.
 *
 * Fix: only climb up when the parent is the git toplevel of the cwd. This
 * means: "user is in a subdir of a git repo, and tracking lives at repo root"
 * — the original intent — without conflating it with "user is in a sibling
 * project under a shared parent directory".
 *
 * This is the canonical TypeScript implementation. The muxy panel mirrors
 * it (see integrations/muxy/stelow/src/panel/data.js — search for
 * "MIRROR of workflow-root"). The herdr Rust plugin uses a different
 * mechanism (HERDR_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_JSON.workspace_cwd from herdr runtime)
 * that achieves the same effect without git calls.

 *   3. cwd as fallback — treat as new project, will create tracking here.
