/**
 * Build the user message that activates the /skill:stelow
 * skill, embedding the user's brief and any @file source contents so the
 * LLM has the full context on first contact. The /sw-start command itself
 * is intercepted and not delivered to the LLM, so without this injection
 * the LLM would need to discover the brief via bash (fragile, easy to lose).
 *
 * Pure function — no imports, no side effects. Kept in a separate file
 * so unit tests can import it without pulling in the full adapter chain
 * (which depends on optional peer deps like @earendil-works/pi-tui).
 *
 * @param displayLabel - Workflow display name
 * @param draftText - User's original brief text
 * @param allSrc - Source file contents (from @refs)
 * @param intent - Detected intent category from /sw-start
 * @param initialPhase - PHASE_NAMES index where workflow starts
