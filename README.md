**Transform product ideas into approved, testable plans — systematically.**

This package brings [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology to AI coding agents. Instead of open-ended feature lists, you shape proposals with clear scope boundaries, validate them through adversarial critique, and generate typed technical scopes ready for autonomous execution.

---

**Key differentiators:**

- **Product domain libraries** — 8 domains auto-detected from your language (Pricing, Trust, Ads, Promotions, Open Source, Health, Marketplace, Business Models)
- **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan in a visual interface for comments, not just chat
- **Interface exploration** — 5 approaches in ASCII art with flows and trade-offs, then LLM creates hybrid combining best points for the context
- **[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology** — IN/OUT scope boundaries, betting table concepts, aphorisms
- **Typed technical scopes** — feature, spike, optimize, test-* with dependency mapping and sequencing
- **Real-time TUI tracking** — see workflow state as it progresses

*"Measure thrice, cut once"* — applies to product decisions, not just code.

## Philosophy

> *"Let's go slow to go fast: invest time in thorough planning to gain speed and deliver value in execution."*

**Traditional AI development:** "Here's what I want. Start coding."

**With cali-product-workflow:** The user just says:

```
/pw-start "Here's what I want to build"
```

And the workflow begins asking questions, exploring scope, shaping the proposal, reviewing for gaps, getting visual approval, and only then generating typed technical scopes for execution.

## About the Author

**[Cali (Renato Caliari)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calirenato82/)**

This workflow wasn't designed in a vacuum. It comes from years inside real teams — as a product manager, consultant, and leader across different organizations. The skills, patterns, and disciplines here were tested, broken, and rebuilt in live product environments, not conference rooms.

## Why This Exists

**The Problem:** Building products with AI agents often leads to:

- Scope creep and unclear boundaries — defining *what not to build* is harder than *what to build*
- Plans without adversarial review — no one questions assumptions before coding begins
- Technical work before business validation — shipping features that shouldn't exist
- No systematic testing for AI-generated code — AI writes fast, but also writes wrong
- Generic workflows missing product-specific insights — pricing, trust, ads, and launch strategy are product decisions, not code decisions

**The Solution:** A structured workflow that makes AI think like a product manager:

- ✅ **Measure thrice, cut once** — shapes proposals with IN/OUT boundaries BEFORE coding
- ✅ **Strategic exploration** — Job To Be Done, Opportunity Mapping, Evolutionary Principles, Market Analysis, and Product Discovery knowledge integrated
- ✅ **Adversarial critique** — reviews every plan for gaps, risks, and assumptions
- ✅ **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)
- ✅ **Interface exploration in ASCII art** — visualize 5 different approaches in seconds, no coding wasted, then LLM creates a hybrid version combining the best points for the context
- ✅ **Domain libraries** — auto-detects 8 product domains (Pricing, Trust, Ads, etc.) from your language
- ✅ **Technical scope mapping** — breaks down into typed scopes, maps dependencies, sequences execution
- ✅ **AI-aware mutation testing** — for software products, with coverage targets and CI gates
- ✅ **Greenfield & Brownfield** — works for new products and existing product evolution

**Key Features:**

- **21 sub-skills** organized into 4 layers — orchestrator + strategies + workflow stages + tactics
- Part of a broader ecosystem of **54+ skills** for coding, ops, research, and facilitation
- Real-time TUI tracking with visual overlay (`/pw-menu`)
- Gate approval via Plannotator — review, comment, approve or reject before implementation
- Typed scopes for autonomous execution (feature, spike, test-*, optimize)

## How We Differ

This workflow combines product planning, domain knowledge, and technical execution for digital products. Here's how it compares:

| Aspect | Standard Agent | Heavy Framework | cali-product-workflow |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Scope** | Open-ended | Full lifecycle | Shaped proposals with IN/OUT |
| **Review** | Manual chat | Configured | Adversarial critique + Gate |
| **Domain Skills** | None | Generic | 8 product-specific (auto-detected) |
| **Testing** | Ad-hoc | Configured | AI-aware mutation coverage |
| **Interface** | None | Coded mockups | ASCII art + tradeoffs + hybrid |
| **Tracking** | None | Varies | Real-time TUI + visual overlay |

### Key Differences

**vs. Claude Code / OpenCode:**

Both have a "plan" mode, but it's basic — restrict tools and add generic planning instructions. There's no structured product thinking: no scope boundaries, no adversarial critique, no domain-specific playbooks, no visual review gates.

- **Shapes proposals before coding** — with clear IN/OUT boundaries
- **Adversarial plan critique** — catches gaps, risks, and assumptions
- **Domain libraries** — auto-detect from user input (pricing, ads, trust, etc.)
- **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)

**vs. [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) (47K ⭐) and [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (199K ⭐):**

Both frameworks enforce structure for general software engineering. Here's what differentiates this workflow:

| Aspect | [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) | [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | cali-product-workflow |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Stars** | ~47K | ~199K | — |
| **Focus** | Enterprise team simulation (12+ workflows) | TDD-first engineering methodology | Product planning + domain knowledge + execution |
| **Phases** | 4 (Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation) | Skills system (14 skills) | 6 (Setup → Strategic → Shape Up → Interface → Critique → Tech) |
| **Scope Definition** | User stories, epics | Implementation plans | Shape Up with IN/OUT boundaries |
| **Domain Knowledge** | Generic product workflows | Code patterns, best practices | Job To Be Done, Pricing, Trust, Ads, Open Source, Health, Marketplace |
| **Review** | Manual or configured checklists | Subagent quality check | Plannotator visual gate with point-by-point comments |
| **Interface** | 1 UX design workflow (ux-spec.md) | 2-3 text approaches + optional browser | 5 ASCII archetypes + LLM hybrid creation |
| **Testing** | Sprint-based (dev-story + code-review) | TDD-first with subagents | Context-aware: TDD critical paths, mutation targets (70/50/30%), greenfield/brownfield |
| **Execution** | Story-by-story sprint cycle | Batch execution with review checkpoints | Typed scopes with dependency mapping and sequencing |

</details>

### Updates

How each CLI stays current with the cali-product-workflow:

| CLI | Update mechanism | Auto? | What updates |
|-----|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Pi** | `pi update` or `pi update --extensions` | ✅ Manual (`pi update`) | Core package (git clone), supporting npm packages |
| **OpenCode** | `npx skills update` | ❌ Manual | Skills only |
| **Claude Code** | `claude plugin update name@marketplace` | ❌ Manual | Plugin + skills |
| **Codex** | `codex plugin marketplace upgrade` | ❌ Manual | Plugin + skills |

**Pi note:** Since the core package is installed via `git:` without a ref pin, `pi update` pulls the latest commit from the default branch. Supporting npm packages are also updated.

**Skills:** `npx skills update` checks GitHub for changes and reinstalls if needed. Run it occasionally to keep skills current across all CLIs.

**Pro tip:** Run `./install.sh update` — it runs `npx skills update` and verifies all skill directories are present.

### Why Git-Based (No npm)

This project distributes **exclusively via GitHub** — no npm publishing. This is a deliberate security choice:

| Risk | npm packages | Git-based (this project) |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Supply chain worms** (Shai-Hulud) | ❌ Worm self-propagates via stolen npm tokens | ✅ No npm token to steal |
| **`preinstall` code execution** | ❌ Scripts run automatically on install | ✅ Only markdown + assets copied |
| **Registry compromise** | ❌ Single centralized registry | ✅ GitHub distributed, auditable |
| **Account takeover blast radius** | ❌ npm token publishes many packages | ✅ Only your repo, no self-propagation |
| **Dependency confusion** | ❌ Possible if public name conflicts | ✅ Impossible — GitHub only source |
| **Maintainer compromise** | ⚠️ Attacker publishes malicious version | ⚠️ **Same risk** — attacker pushes malicious commit |
| **Third-party npm deps** (pi-subagents, etc.) | ⚠️ Subject to all npm risks above | ⚠️ **Same risk** — installed via npm regardless |

**Tradeoff:** Without npm, CLIs that rely on npm for JS plugins (e.g., OpenCode) are limited to skills. Deep integrations (hooks, TUI, slash commands) work only on Pi, which supports native Git install via `pi install git:...`.

**Bottom line:** Git-based distribution solves the risks we *control* (how we ship our code). Risks we *inherit* (maintainer compromise, third-party deps) are shared with all software — managed through defense in depth, not eliminated.

### Third-Party Dependency Management

Third-party npm dependencies exist **only for Pi**. OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex use only skills (markdown files) — our code is never distributed via npm. (The `npx skills` CLI itself is an npm package, but it's a well-audited Vercel tool used to fetch markdown from GitHub — not our runtime.)

For protection against supply chain risks (for Pi's npm deps and general development), see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

Pi requires these npm packages for deep integration (slash commands, TUI, event hooks):

| Package | Purpose | Can use `git:`? |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `pi-subagents` | Parallel agent orchestration | ✅ `git:github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents` |
| `@capyup/pi-goal` | Goal management with status overlay | ✅ `git:github.com/Michaelliv/pi-goal` |
| `pi-intercom` | Session coordination | ✅ `git:github.com/nicobailon/pi-intercom` |
| `pi-supervisor` | Conversation supervision | ✅ `git:github.com/tintinweb/pi-supervisor` |
| `pi-autoresearch` | Autonomous research | ✅ `git:github.com/davebcn87/pi-autoresearch` |
| `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question` | User prompts | ✅ `git:github.com/juicesharp/rpiv-mono` |
| `@plannotator/pi-extension` | Visual plan review | ✅ `git:github.com/backnotprop/plannotator` |

Switching from `npm:` to `git:` does not change the security profile — the code is identical. The effective mitigation is defense in depth, not replacing the registry channel.

**Our distribution model (GitHub, no self-publish) and our dependency model (npm for Pi packages) address different risk layers** — a distinction recognized by:

- **[OWASP Dependency Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)** — Open Web Application Security Project standard for identifying known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **[NIST SSDF](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf)** — US National Institute of Standards and Technology's Secure Software Development Framework, which separates producer/distributor controls from consumer/dependency controls
- **[ENISA Supply Chain Guidance](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supply-chain-guidelines)** — European Union Agency for Cybersecurity guidelines distinguishing first-party distribution integrity from third-party dependency risk

**How we handle it today:**

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Regular `pi update` | ✅ Already documented | `pi update --extensions` keeps all packages current |
| Pi's built-in lockfile | ✅ Already happens | Pi runs `npm install` internally, which generates and respects lockfiles |

**On pinning:** Not recommended for actively maintained packages. A 2026 study ([Pinning Is Futile, arXiv 2502.06662](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06662)) found that pinning *increases* vulnerability exposure — pinned packages go stale because teams forget to update them. For packages with weekly releases (e.g., `pi-subagents` with 77 versions), **staying current via `pi update` is safer than pinning**.

**Skill-only mode (avoid npm entirely):** Set `INSTALL_SKILLS_ONLY=1` to skip all npm package installation:

```bash
INSTALL_SKILLS_ONLY=1 ./install.sh
```

This applies only to **Pi** — the other CLIs (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex) already have zero npm dependencies. In this mode, Pi loses slash commands and TUI overlay, but the `cali-product-workflow` skill still works normally.

**For development dependencies (TypeScript, Vitest, Stryker):** We use `.npmrc` with `save-exact=true` to keep our own toolchain deterministic.

**Recommended for users:** See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for a guide on supply chain security tools (Socket.dev + Snyk) and how to set them up.

### Agent Instructions Setup

The installer **does not modify** your AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md automatically. This is intentional:

- **Safety:** Auto-modifying agent instructions can break existing workflows. Your agent config is yours.
- **Idempotence:** No cleanup needed on uninstall — no traces left behind.
- **Awareness:** You should consciously review what instructions your agent follows.
- **Portability:** Different agents use different files (`AGENTS.md` vs `CLAUDE.md`). You decide what fits.

After installation, manually add this to your agent's instructions file:

````markdown
## cali-product-workflow Integration

When working on software projects, trigger the product workflow:

1. **Trigger:** Use `/skill cali-product-workflow`
3. **Execute:** Only after visual review gate (Plannotator approval)
