**Transform product ideas into approved, testable plans - systematically.**

This package brings [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology to AI coding agents. Instead of open-ended feature lists, you shape proposals with clear scope boundaries, validate them through adversarial critique, and generate typed technical scopes ready for autonomous execution.

> **Built by a former product manager, for AI agents.** I've led product teams, taught product leadership, and advised product strategy with founders and product leaders. stelow is that experience, systematized for AI. No conference-room theory. Lessons from live products, shipped features, and real teams. [More about my background.](#about-the-author)

> 🎯 *"Measure thrice, cut once"* - applies to product decisions, not just code.

**Key differentiators:**

- **Shape Up methodology for AI agents** - IN/OUT scope boundaries, appetite-driven sizing, risk analysis, focused scoping. Every proposal is a shaped bet, not a wishlist.
- **Appetite × Mode stage control** - Two orthogonal dimensions control the full workflow: how deep to prepare (Appetite: Lean / Core / Complete) and which stages run (Mode: Auto / Light / Moderate / Full Product / Full Product + Tech). The cascade propagates automatically through critique depth, supervisor use, verification rigor, and gate requirements - no manual stage skipping needed.
- **Adversarial plan critique** - Plans are reviewed for gaps, risks, and assumptions by parallel (fresh context) reviewers, not just approved in chat.
- **Visual review gate** - Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments before implementation, not a rubber-stamp approval.
- **Appetite-scaled interface exploration** - 1, 3, or 5 ASCII archetypes plus hybrid depending on scope depth - no coded mockups wasted.
- **Product domain libraries** - 8 domains auto-detected from your language (Pricing, Trust, Ads, Promotions, Open Source, Health, Marketplace, Business Models).
- **Typed technical scopes** - feature, spike, optimize, test-* with dependency mapping and sequencing for autonomous execution.
- **Acceptance-based scope execution** - each scope is delegated with a contract (criteria, verify commands, stop rules). On acceptance-native harnesses (e.g. pi-subagents), the child self-corrects in the same context before returning. On other harnesses, the parent re-delegates with feedback until criteria pass or max iterations exhaust.
- **Audit gap-to-scope loop** — post-execution audit classifies gaps (FIXED / DOCUMENTED / ESCALATED). ESCALATED gaps become new scopes in the tracking file. `/sw-next` enforces the loop: when pending scopes exist at the Audit phase, it blocks completion and resets to Execution. The cycle repeats until no scopes remain pending.
- **Stack-matched skills + fresh docs** — during execution setup, the workflow discovers skills (via `npx skills`) optimized for the chosen tech stack and fetches current library docs (via `ctx7`). Both skip if already installed or unavailable. Skills install in project scope only, after user confirmation.
- **Real-time TUI tracking** - see workflow state as it progresses through all stages.

## Philosophy

> *"Let's go slow to go fast: invest time in thorough planning to gain speed and deliver value in execution."*

**Traditional AI development:** "Here's what I want. Start coding."

**With stelow:** The user just says:

```
/sw-start "Here's what I want to build"
```

And the workflow begins asking questions, exploring scope, shaping the proposal, reviewing for gaps, getting visual approval, and only then generating typed technical scopes for execution.

**Critique → Gate → Scope sequencing.** Execution (stage 12) only runs after all three pass. Lighter modes (Auto/Light) skip some gates; the full path is there when you need it.

## Why This Exists

**The Problem:** Building products with AI agents often leads to:

- Scope creep and unclear boundaries - defining *what not to build* is harder than *what to build*
- Plans without adversarial review - no one questions assumptions before coding begins
- Technical work before business validation - shipping features that shouldn't exist
- No systematic testing for AI-generated code - AI writes fast, but also writes wrong
- Generic workflows missing product-specific insights - pricing, trust, ads, and launch strategy are product decisions, not code decisions

**The Solution:** A structured workflow that makes AI think like a product manager:

- ✅ **Measure thrice, cut once** - shapes proposals with IN/OUT boundaries BEFORE coding
- ✅ **Strategic exploration** - Job To Be Done, Opportunity Mapping, Evolutionary Principles, Market Analysis, and Product Discovery knowledge integrated
- ✅ **Adversarial critique** - reviews every plan for gaps, risks, and assumptions
- ✅ **Visual review gate** - Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)
- ✅ **Interface exploration in ASCII art** - visualize 5 different approaches in seconds, no coding wasted, then LLM creates a hybrid version combining the best points for the context
- ✅ **Domain libraries** - auto-detects 8 product domains (Pricing, Trust, Ads, etc.) from your language
- ✅ **Technical scope mapping** - breaks down into typed scopes, maps dependencies, sequences execution
- ✅ **AI-aware testing strategy** - for software products, with coverage targets and CI gates
- ✅ **Greenfield & Brownfield** - works for new products and existing product evolution

**Key Features:**

- **24 sub-skills** organized into 4 layers - orchestrator + strategies + workflow stages + tactics
- Part of a broader ecosystem of **25 skills within the project** (plus additional skills from other packages in the user's agent environment)
- Real-time TUI tracking with visual overlay (`/sw-menu`)
- Gate approval via Plannotator - review, comment, approve or reject before implementation
- Typed scopes for autonomous execution (feature, spike, test-*, optimize)

## 🎚️ Appetite & Mode

The workflow is controlled by two orthogonal dimensions: **Appetite** (declared by the human) and **Mode** (declared by the human). Appetite controls scope/exploration depth. Mode controls gates, questions, and approvals.

### Appetite (Constraint, Not Estimate)

Appetite is the **scope and exploration budget** - how much product depth the human wants prepared before execution.

> **Appetite is a constraint, not an estimate.** Unlike traditional estimation (which asks "how long will this take?"), appetite asks "how much is this worth?" before the work is defined. This forces scope cuts to fit the budget - the budget never expands.

| Appetite | What it means | Scope depth | Interface exploration | Supervisor | Testing | Best for |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Lean** | Validate an idea fast. Minimal scope ceremony. | 1 minimal feature, 1-2 scopes | 1 suggested interface; no alternative exploration | Low sensitivity | Smoke tests + critical-path unit tests; a11y lint/static if UI exists | Idea validation, spike, throwaway prototype |
| **Core (default)** | Standard product feature. Enough depth to catch obvious gaps. | Main JTBD, 3-5 scopes | 3 interface archetypes explored + 1 hybrid recommendation | Medium sensitivity | Unit tests + integration tests for external seams; a11y codebase/browserless audit if UI exists | Most features, bug fixes, small improvements |
| **Complete** | Multi-feature or high-risk product work. | 8-15 scopes, full edge mapping | 5 interface archetypes explored + 1 hybrid recommendation | High sensitivity | Unit + integration + behavior/e2e + security tests; live a11y audit if UI exists | Critical features, high-risk changes, production releases |

**Cut policy implied by appetite:**

| Appetite | What to cut first |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Lean** | Edge cases, secondary flows, alternative strategies, non-critical integrations. Keep only the happy path. |
| **Core** | Low-value variants. Keep the main JTBD, obvious edge cases, and one alternative only if it changes the core flow. |
| **Complete** | Cut nothing unless impossible. Keep full edge case mapping, multiple implementation strategies, and domain context. |

After shaping, a fresh-context subagent assesses **`appetite_fit`** (see Shape Up SKILL.md — appetite_fit Validation section): does the shaped proposal fit within the declared appetite?

| `appetite_fit` | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `fits` | Proposal fits within appetite - proceed as shaped |
| `cuts_needed` | Proposal almost fits but needs targeted cuts (LLM suggests what; human decides) |
| `reshape` | Proposal fundamentally exceeds appetite - must be reshaped before continuing |

This is **not an estimate**. The LLM does not estimate effort - it checks whether the shaped design fits the human's declared budget. If it doesn't fit, the LLM proposes cuts or reshaping, never an appetite extension. The final decision is always human.

All three appetites benefit from a fresh-context `appetite_fit` reviewer. The same LLM that shaped the proposal has anchoring bias — it will under-report fit issues. The Shape Up stage delegates `appetite_fit` to a fresh-context subagent (reading the spec + appetite, returning fits/cuts_needed/reshape). For Lean work, self-assessment is an acceptable shortcut when speed matters.

**Critique and Gate are Mode controls, not Appetite controls.** Product Critique and Plannotator Gate are governed by Mode: Auto skips gates; Light/Moderate/Full modes run the configured gates. Appetite changes the depth of the shaped proposal, interface exploration, supervisor sensitivity, and test scope breadth — not whether quality gates exist.

**Appetite-specific execution budget:**

| Area | Lean | Core | Complete |
|------|------|------|----------|
| **Spec + scopes** | ~1 page; 1-2 scopes; one direct implementation path | ~3 pages; 3-5 scopes; 1-2 implementation alternatives with brief rationale | ~8+ pages; 8-15 scopes; 3-5 alternatives with trade-offs |
| **Cut policy** | Cut edge cases, secondary flows, alternative strategies, non-critical integrations. Keep the happy path. | Cut low-value variants. Keep main JTBD, obvious edge cases, and one alternative only if it changes the core flow. | Cut nothing unless impossible. Keep full edge mapping, multiple strategies, and domain context. |
| **Interface exploration** | 1 suggested interface only | 3 archetypes explored + 1 hybrid recommendation | 5 archetypes explored + 1 hybrid recommendation |
| **Supervisor** | Low sensitivity | Medium sensitivity | High sensitivity |
| **Testing** | Smoke tests + critical-path unit tests | Unit tests + integration tests for external seams | Unit + integration + behavior/e2e + security tests |
| **Quality baseline** | Build/test/lint/typecheck always; a11y lint/static if UI exists | Build/test/lint/typecheck always; a11y codebase/browserless audit if UI exists | Build/test/lint/typecheck always; live a11y audit if UI exists |

### Mode

Mode controls the **breadth** of the workflow - how many gates and questions are active. Unlike Appetite (depth of scope), Mode determines the **level of interaction** with the human.

Mode is set explicitly by the user during `setup:15` via `ask_user_question`. It is NOT auto-detected.

| Mode | Plannotator Gates | Interface | IN/OUT Confirmation | Tech Approval | Best for |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---------|
| **Auto** | None | standard (fixo) | LLM decides | Auto | Throwaway prototype, quick validation, spike |
| **Light** | **1 pre-tech** | standard (fixo) | LLM decides | Auto | Standard feature, bug fix, small improvement |
| **Moderate** | **1 pre-tech** | **User chooses** | LLM decides | Auto | Feature where interface matters |
| **Full Product** | **Gate + Int.Gate** | User chooses | **User confirms** | Auto | Critical feature, product with domain context |
| **Full Product + Tech** | **Gate + Int.Gate** | User chooses | User confirms | **Gate + tech Qs** | Full pipeline, high-risk changes, production |

**Key rules:**

- **Auto:** No gates, no Plannotator, no questions. LLM decides everything. Quickest path.
- **Light:** One Plannotator gate (spec-product visual approval before tech planning). Interface depth follows Appetite. User does not choose between alternatives. All other gates skipped.
- **Moderate:** Same as Light + user chooses between generated interface alternatives via the ask tool with preview.
- **Full Product:** All gates active (pre-tech + int-gate). User confirms IN/OUT boundaries. Tech approval uses Auto (no Plannotator for tech plan).
- **Full Product + Tech:** Everything in Full Product + tech plan goes through Plannotator gate + user answers technical questions.

### How Appetite & Mode Interact

```
Mode controls WHAT runs (breadth)     →  Light vs Full Product, etc.
Appetite controls HOW DEEP it runs     →  Lean vs Core vs Complete
```

| | Lean | Core | Complete |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto** | No gates. Fastest path: smaller spec, minimal verify. | No gates. Standard planning depth, standard verify. | No gates. Deep planning, full verify. |
| **Full Product** | 2 gates (Gate + Int.Gate). User confirms IN/OUT. | 2 gates + IN/OUT confirmation. Full workflow. | 2 gates + all questions. No shortcuts. |

**Examples:**
- `Lean + Auto` → Fastest path: no gates, no questions, no Plannotator. LLM decides scope. Interface runs automatically with 1 suggested interface. (~6 stages)
- `Core + Light` → Standard feature: 1 Plannotator gate (pre-tech), interface runs automatically with 3 interfaces + hybrid. (~10 stages)
- `Core + Moderate` → Feature where interface matters: 1 Plannotator gate + user chooses among 3 interfaces + hybrid. (~8 stages)
- `Complete + Full Product` → Critical feature: 2 Plannotator gates + all questions. Interface explores all 5 archetypes + hybrid. No shortcuts. (~13 stages)

### Motivation

Product ideas vary widely in scope and risk. A throwaway prototype should not require the same planning depth as a critical production feature. The Appetite × Mode cascade system ensures:

- **Lean appetite limits scope and exploration** - smaller spec, fewer scopes, one interface suggestion, and critical-path tests only.
- **Complete appetite expands exploration and verification** - full edge mapping, all 5 interface archetypes + hybrid, behavior/e2e tests, security tests, and live a11y audit when UI exists.
- **Auto mode skips Plannotator** - for lightweight validations where visual review is overkill
- **Full Product mode enforces strategy** - JTBD, Opportunity Mapping, etc. run before shaping if product context exists

This is an **appetite-first** design: the human's declaration of review budget propagates automatically through all stages - no estimation step required.

---

## 🔄 Process

The workflow has **3 conceptual phases** (15 stages total), from idea triage to post-execution audit. See the [Stage Index](#-skills) in the orchestrator skill for the complete stage map with auto-chain rules and flow diagram.

### 1. 🎨 Shaping

**Stages 0-11** - From raw idea through shaped proposal, adversarial critique, visual gate approval, interface exploration, to typed technical scopes ready for execution.

### 2. ⚡ Execution

**Stages 12-13** - Autonomous scope execution via acceptance contracts: each scope is delegated with criteria, verify commands, and stop rules. Self-correction is harness-dependent - native acceptance loops (pi-subagents) let the child fix gaps in the same context; other harnesses use parent-controlled re-delegation. Optimization scopes use benchmark-driven iteration. Scope completion is gated - `/sw-next` blocks advance to Verification if any scopes remain incomplete.

### 3. ✅ Verification & Audit

**Stage 14** — Full test suite, parallel code review, UI quality audit, and execution critique (scope fidelity, NFR coverage, edge cases, docs, test quality). The audit classifies gaps as FIXED / DOCUMENTED / ESCALATED. ESCALATED gaps become new scopes. `/sw-next` detects pending scopes at the Audit phase and loops back to Execution.

## 📋 Skills

All 25 skills are flat in `skills/` directory, ready for `~/.agents/skills/`. They're organized into 4 layers plus 1 complementary skill.

**Each skill is fully self-contained** - the installer copies the complete directory tree including its own `references/cli-tools/`, `references/`, and `stages/` files. This means:
- ✅ **Skills work standalone** - invoke any sub-skill (e.g., `cali-product-shape-up`, `cali-product-plan-critique`) independently of the orchestrator
- ✅ **Portable across CLIs** - Pi, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode all reference skills by name (`~/.agents/skills/`)
- ✅ **References resolve locally** - every `references/cli-tools/*.md` path is relative to the skill's own directory
- ❌ **Not in `~/.agents/skills/`?** Use `./install.sh` or `npx skills add renatocaliari/stelow -g`

## 🚀 Quick Start

This package works across **multiple coding agents** - not just pi.dev. See the compatibility table in [Installation](#-installation) to pick your path.

| Your situation | Recommended command | What you get |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **New to CLIs** (no Node, no agent) | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../setup.sh \| sh` | Node.js + pi.dev + all extensions + 25 skills |
| **Already use pi.dev** | `git clone ... && ./install.sh` | 25 skills + TUI overlay + slash commands |
| **Use OpenCode / Claude Code / Codex** | `git clone ... && ./install.sh` | 25 skills + command files (no TUI) |
| **Any CLI (skills only)** | `npx skills add renatocaliari/stelow -g` | 25 skills + cross-CLI support |

See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed options.
Per-agent configuration files (commands, install scripts) are in [`cli-agents/`](cli-agents/).

## 📦 Installation

### CLI Compatibility

Not every feature works on every CLI. Here's what to expect:

| Feature | pi.dev | OpenCode | Claude Code | Codex |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Skills (all 25)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **`/sw-start`, `/sw-menu` commands** | ✅ Slash commands | ✅ Via `sw-*.md` files | ✅ Via command files | ✅ Via command files |
| **TUI overlay (real-time status)** | ✅ Native | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Plannotator visual gate** | ✅ Extension | ⚠️ Manual | ⚠️ Manual | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Deep hooks (events, gates)** | ✅ Extension | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> **Bottom line:** The **25 skills work identically on every CLI** - they run the full Shape Up workflow, generate plans, critique, scopes, everything. The TUI overlay and deep integration features are Pi-only because only Pi exposes an extension system. All CLIs can still complete the workflow; it just happens in chat rather than a visual panel.

---

### 🚀 Path A: From Zero (pi.dev + Everything)

**One command, everything included.** Pick this if you don't have pi.dev yet.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renatocaliari/stelow/main/setup.sh | sh
```

**What gets installed:**

| Component | Details | Works on |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Node.js** | v20+ (if not installed) | - |
| **pi.dev** | Latest version | pi.dev |
| **Extensions (22)** | subagents, browser, intercom, supervisor, plannotator, etc. | pi.dev only |
| **Skills (25)** | Shape Up, JTBD, Pricing, Ads, Discovery, code-standards, and more | **All CLIs** ✅ |
| **Settings** | Theme, model defaults, skill shortcuts | pi.dev |

> **Not using pi.dev?** The skills are still installed to `~/.agents/skills/` - they work on OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex too. You just won't get the Pi-only extensions or TUI. The workflow itself runs fine.

### 📋 Path B: Existing pi.dev User

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renatocaliari/stelow.git
cd stelow
./install.sh
```

The installer auto-detects your CLIs and installs skills + extensions + slash commands. Skills go to `~/.agents/skills/`.

### 📋 Path C: Other CLI (OpenCode / Claude Code / Codex)

The **skills** are the core of this project - they work on **any** agent (Pi, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renatocaliari/stelow.git
cd stelow
./install.sh
```

The installer detects your CLI and installs **skills + command files**. No extensions, no TUI - just the 25 skills that run the workflow.

**Or, with npx (no clone needed):**

```bash
npx skills add renatocaliari/stelow -g
```

This installs all 25 skills to `~/.agents/skills/` - works on any CLI.

> For CLI-specific setup (OpenCode config, Claude Code plugin, Codex plugin), see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

The Muxy panel shows:

- Current phase and progress
- Phase artifacts and outputs
- Upcoming tasks
- Quick actions

```
<project>/.pi/workflow/
```

| Subdirectory | Contents |

## How We Differ

This workflow combines product planning, domain knowledge, and technical execution for digital products. Here's how it compares:

| Aspect | Standard Agent | Engineering-Focused Framework | Product-Focused Framework (this project) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Scope** | Open-ended | Full lifecycle | Shaped proposals with IN/OUT |
| **Review** | Manual chat | Configured | Adversarial critique + Gate |
| **Execution** | One-shot | Manual iteration | Acceptance contract + self-correction (harness-dependent) |
| **Post-execution** | Done | Manual QA | Audit classifies gaps → ESCALATED become scopes → `/sw-next` enforces loop |
| **Domain Skills** | None | Generic | 8 product-specific (auto-detected) |
| **Testing** | Ad-hoc | Configured | AI-aware test strategy |
| **Interface** | None | Coded mockups | ASCII art + tradeoffs + hybrid |
| **Tracking** | None | Varies | Real-time TUI + Muxy.app visual overlay |

### Key Differences

**vs. Claude Code / OpenCode:**

Both have a "plan" mode, but it's basic - restrict tools and add generic planning instructions. There's no structured product thinking: no scope boundaries, no adversarial critique, no domain-specific playbooks, no visual review gates.

- **Shapes proposals before coding** - with clear IN/OUT boundaries
- **Adversarial plan critique** - catches gaps, risks, and assumptions
- **Domain libraries** - auto-detect from user input (pricing, ads, trust, etc.)
- **Visual review gate** - Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)

**vs. [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) (47K ⭐) and [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (199K ⭐):**

Both frameworks enforce structure for general software engineering. What differentiates this workflow - appetite × mode control with automatic cascade - is not present in either framework. Shape Up methodology over generic engineering, product domain libraries, and multi-angle adversarial critique are also unique differentiators.

## 📖 Evidence & Limitations

### ✅ Evidence-Based Design

This workflow is grounded in empirical evidence from the 2025-2026 AI agent research boom. Every architectural decision - from parallel subagent orchestration to cross-session learning - is backed by peer-reviewed papers, open-source tools, and industry benchmarks.

| Practice | Source | Evidence | Where We Implement |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Parallel orchestration** | [CAID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.21489) (Geng & Neubig, CMU, 2026) | +26.7% accuracy using git-worktree isolation + dependency DAG | `critique:30` - 5 parallel reviewers + consolidator |
| **Cross-session learning** | [Cat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22087) (Liu et al., Beihang, 2025); [Memory Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.14004) (Kim et al., KAIST, 2026) | Context as callable tool; +3.7% via abstract memory pools | `setup:0.30` - Session Knowledge from `.stelow/session-knowledge/` |

### ⚠️ Known Limitations & Radical Transparency

Even with these guardrails, the AI agent still exhibits predictable failure modes. This workflow is a tool for **amplifying human judgment**, not a substitute for it.

**How to read this table:** Each row is honest about what the workflow can and cannot do. Every mitigation has a corresponding "not solved" assessment. Read both before deciding whether this workflow helps your context.

| # | Limitation | Impact | What the workflow tries to do | Why it's not solved |
|---|-----------|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Context rot** - compliance with own rules drops from ~73% (turn 5) to ~33% (turn 16) in long sessions | [Gamage 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.20911), 4,416 trials, 12 models/8 providers. Replicated by Liu et al. 2023 "Lost in the Middle". | Subagents use `context: "fresh"`. Ordered-execution-goal creates isolated scope execution. Execution stage has explicit "Context Rot Check" re-reading plan from disk. | **Reduced but not solved.** The orchestrator itself can forget its own rules in long sessions spanning multiple stages. The core transformer limitation (U-shaped attention curve) remains intrinsic. |
| 2 | **Confabulated research references** - Agents cite nonexistent papers or books (~11-57% hallucination rate across models) | [arXiv 2604.03173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.03173) - 10 models/3 databases/69K citation instances | Claim verification in `setup:0.20` (Lessons Learned cross-referencing). | **Caught by structure, not guaranteed.** Multi-model consensus (≥3 LLMs citing same work) yields 95.6% accuracy, but the workflow doesn't enforce this. |
| 3 | **Silent wrong answers** - Cross-task state leakage produces plausible but incorrect outputs | [UCC (arXiv 2604.01350)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.01350), 2026 | Write isolation per subagent; clean context pattern | **Mitigated by isolation, not by detection.** No mechanism to detect when contamination happens despite isolation. |
| 4 | **Overconfidence in estimates** - AI systematically underestimates implementation complexity | [Agentic Overconfidence (ICLR 2026)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ld4bvamfKj) - all tested agents exhibit agentic overconfidence | Appetite is declared by human as a **constraint**, not estimated by the LLM. The LLM only checks `appetite_fit` (fits/cuts_needed/reshape). No estimation step. | **Addressed by design - appetite is a constraint, not an estimate.** The human sets the budget before shaping. The LLM checks fit, not effort. But the human still needs to set appetite honestly. |
| 5 | **Approval gate fatigue** - Users can desensitize to visual gates and approve without scrutiny | [Tian Pan Apr 2026](https://tianpan.co/blog/2026-04-23-hitl-queue-dynamics-approver-fatigue) - HITL queues have dynamics | Plannotator requires active annotations (deletions, comments, labels). Light+Auto mode skips gates entirely when appropriate. | **Delayed, not prevented.** Mode selection helps reduce unnecessary gates, but if the human always picks Complete+Full Product, fatigue still sets in. |
| 6 | **80% Problem** - AI ships the happy path (CRUD, main flow) but omits error handling, observability, security, retry, rollback, edge cases | [Osmani Jan 2026](https://addyo.substack.com/p/the-80-problem-in-agentic-coding) (coined the term); [GitClear 2025](https://www.gitclear.com/ai_assistant_code_quality_2025_research) | Tech Planning requires NFRs per scope. Acceptance contracts can include NFR criteria (if the plan specifies them). Audit classifies omissions as gaps - ESCALATED ones become new scopes. | **Partially mitigated, not solved.** NFRs must be in the plan to appear in the contract. Audit classification depends on the LLM - misclassification means gaps slip through. Same model evaluates both stages. |
| 7 | **Model dependency** - Claude Opus, Gemini Flash, GPT-4o produce significantly different quality | [Veracode 2025](https://www.veracode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025_GenAI_Code_Security_Report_Final.pdf) - 45% of AI-generated code contains flaws across 100+ models; [Anthropic Jan 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245) - RCT: AI-assisted devs score 17% lower on comprehension tests | Every artifact tracks `generated_by: {model_name}` in frontmatter. Gate stage shows provenance before Plannotator review. | **Transparency, not mitigation.** Knowing the model helps calibrate expectations, but it doesn't fix the quality gap. The comprehension penalty (Anthropic 2026) affects users regardless. |
| 8 | **Constraint decay** - AI progressively violates its own self-imposed rules over time | [arXiv 2026 (Constraint Decay)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.06445) - structural constraints drift in backend code generation; [HORIZON](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.11978) - agents break on long-horizon tasks | Context rot rules explicitly warn about this. "No patching in degraded context" rule blocks the most common decay pattern. | **Same root cause as context rot.** The warning helps, but stopping a session mid-flow is disruptive and users rarely do it. |
| 9 | **Code hallucination** - AI invents APIs, functions, or contracts that don't exist (~20% of failures) | [CloudAPIBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09726) - 20.41% of failures are hallucinated APIs; [Code LLM failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06153) | Verification stage runs the test suite, which catches some hallucinated APIs. | **Caught by tests, not by the workflow.** If tests don't exist (or are also hallucinated), neither Verification nor Critique detects it. |
| 10 | **Shallow review trap** - same LLM that wrote the code also reviews it | [Ox Security 2025](https://www.ox.security/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Army-of-Juniors-The-AI-Code-Security-Crisis.pdf) - 300+ repos, 10 anti-patterns, AI code in production with critical flaws | Verification uses `context: "fresh"` subagent reviewers - same model but fresh session context. | **Automatic via `context: "fresh"`** - fresh context restores full rule awareness lost to context rot (~33% rule adherence at turn 16 vs ~73% at turn 5). True cross-model independence offers marginal additional benefit. |
| 11 | **Expertise cliff** - AI fails in mature codebases with implicit conventions, undocumented architecture | [Tian Pan Mai 2026](https://tianpan.co/blog/2026-05-04-expertise-cliff-tacit-knowledge-ai-coding-agents); [METR 2025 RCT](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) - experienced devs 19% slower with AI | Domain libraries and structured specs help surface some conventions. Execution Critique checks for broken refs and anti-patterns. | **Not addressed.** This workflow was designed for greenfield or well-documented features. If your codebase has 10 years of undocumented architecture decisions, the AI will violate them. |
| 12 | **Plan staleness** - plans generated against one snapshot; by execution time, target has changed | [Superpowers Issue #989](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/989) - parallel sessions cause spec/plan staleness | Git diff check before scope execution detects if target files changed since plan creation. | **Staleness detected but not auto-resolved.** Only detects file-level changes, not semantic staleness. LLM decides whether staleness matters - no forced re-plan. |
| 13 | **Pipeline memory loss** - no cross-session memory of own failure patterns | [Flamehaven 2026](https://flamehaven.space/writing/the-two-problems-no-one-talks-about-in-ai-agent-coding-pipelines/) - cross-session memory, MICA governance schema | Execution Critique saves lessons to `.stelow/lessons-learned/`. Setup stage automatically reads past lessons with forced reflection. | **Captured and injected, but not verified.** Same model that made mistakes reads the lessons. Context rot can still cause mid-session forgetting. Cannot auto-verify lesson adherence. |
| 14 | **Code complexity growth** - AI-generated code increases complexity over time | [Cursor Study (MSR 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427) - static analysis warnings +30%, code complexity +41% after month 2 | Execution Critique includes anti-pattern detection (god functions >100 lines, global mutable state). Optional Code Quality Gate with static analysis. | **Caught too late.** Complexity analysis happens after code is written. No mechanism to prevent complexity during generation - only flag it after. |
| 15 | **Activity ≠ productivity** - more PRs, more commits does not mean more value delivered | [METR 2025 RCT](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) - 19% slower for experienced devs; [Faros AI 2025](https://www.faros.ai/ai-productivity-paradox) - 9% more tasks, 0% DORA improvement | Appetite system anchors scope size to human attention budget. OUT/IN scoping keeps proposals focused. Execution Critique includes "close without follow-up" as valid outcome. | **Honest assessment:** Appetite system mitigates scope bloat, but requires human to set appetite honestly. `appetite_fit` now uses a fresh-context subagent for independent review (mitigating self-assessment bias). The appetite system is new - its real-world effectiveness is not yet measured. |

### What this means for you

- **Every artifact is a draft.** Treat spec-product.md, spec-tech.md, critique reports, and interface proposals as first drafts that need human eyes.
- **Results vary by model and codebase.** A small model generating a plan for a mature codebase is a recipe for failure - regardless of how structured the workflow is.
- **Human review is required.** The workflow catches structural gaps (missing scopes, contradictory requirements, some untested edge cases). It does NOT catch logic errors in individual lines, security flaws in business logic, or nuanced architectural trade-offs - those need you.
- **None of the 15 problems above are solved by any framework.** Not BMAD (47K⭐), not Superpowers (199K⭐), not SpecKit, not GSD. We're transparent about it because the limitation is not in any framework - it's in the technology itself.

> We don't claim to solve product planning. We claim to **structure the thinking** so you catch more before you code. The rest is still up to you.
