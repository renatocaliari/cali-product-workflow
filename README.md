**Transform product ideas into approved, testable plans — systematically.**

This package brings [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology to AI coding agents. Instead of open-ended feature lists, you shape proposals with clear scope boundaries, validate them through adversarial critique, and generate typed technical scopes ready for autonomous execution.

---

**Key differentiators:**

- **Product domain libraries** — 8 domains auto-detected from your language (Pricing, Trust, Ads, Promotions, Open Source, Health, Marketplace, Business Models)
- **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan in a visual interface for comments, not just chat
- **Interface exploration** — 5 approaches in ASCII art with flows and trade-offs, then LLM creates hybrid combining best points for the context
- **[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology** — IN/OUT scope boundaries, betting table concepts, aphorisms
- **Typed technical scopes** — feature, spike, optimize, test-* with dependency mapping and sequencing
- **Real-time TUI tracking** — see workflow state as it progresses

*"Measure thrice, cut once"* — applies to product decisions, not just code.

## Philosophy

> *"Let's go slow to go fast: invest time in thorough planning to gain speed and deliver value in execution."*

**Traditional AI development:** "Here's what I want. Start coding."

**With cali-product-workflow:** The user just says:

```
/pw:start "Here's what I want to build"
```

And the workflow begins asking questions, exploring scope, shaping the proposal, reviewing for gaps, getting visual approval, and only then generating typed technical scopes for execution.

## Why This Exists

**The Problem:** Building products with AI agents often leads to:

- Scope creep and unclear boundaries — defining *what not to build* is harder than *what to build*
- Plans without adversarial review — no one questions assumptions before coding begins
- Technical work before business validation — shipping features that shouldn't exist
- No systematic testing for AI-generated code — AI writes fast, but also writes wrong
- Generic workflows missing product-specific insights — pricing, trust, ads, and launch strategy are product decisions, not code decisions

**The Solution:** A structured workflow that makes AI think like a product manager:

- ✅ **Measure thrice, cut once** — shapes proposals with IN/OUT boundaries BEFORE coding
- ✅ **Strategic exploration** — Job To Be Done, Opportunity Mapping, Evolutionary Principles, Market Analysis, and Product Discovery knowledge integrated
- ✅ **Adversarial critique** — reviews every plan for gaps, risks, and assumptions
- ✅ **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)
- ✅ **Interface exploration in ASCII art** — visualize 5 different approaches in seconds, no coding wasted, then LLM creates a hybrid version combining the best points for the context
- ✅ **Domain libraries** — auto-detects 8 product domains (Pricing, Trust, Ads, etc.) from your language
- ✅ **Technical scope mapping** — breaks down into typed scopes, maps dependencies, sequences execution
- ✅ **AI-aware mutation testing** — for software products, with coverage targets and CI gates
- ✅ **Greenfield & Brownfield** — works for new products and existing product evolution

**Key Features:**

- 16 specialized product skills (Job To Be Done, Opportunity Mapping, Product Discovery, Pricing, Promotions, Trust Building, and more)
- Real-time TUI tracking with visual overlay (`/pw:menu`)
- Gate approval via Plannotator — review, comment, approve or reject before implementation
- Typed scopes for autonomous execution (feature, spike, test-*, optimize)

## How We Differ

This workflow combines product planning, domain knowledge, and technical execution for digital products. Here's how it compares:

| Aspect | Standard Agent | Heavy Framework | cali-product-workflow |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Scope** | Open-ended | Full lifecycle | Shaped proposals with IN/OUT |
| **Review** | Manual chat | Configured | Adversarial critique + Gate |
| **Domain Skills** | None | Generic | 8 product-specific (auto-detected) |
| **Testing** | Ad-hoc | Configured | AI-aware mutation coverage |
| **Interface** | None | Coded mockups | ASCII art + tradeoffs + hybrid |
| **Tracking** | None | Varies | Real-time TUI + visual overlay |

### Key Differences

**vs. Claude Code / OpenCode:**

Both have a "plan" mode, but it's basic — restrict tools and add generic planning instructions. There's no structured product thinking: no scope boundaries, no adversarial critique, no domain-specific playbooks, no visual review gates.

- **Shapes proposals before coding** — with clear IN/OUT boundaries
- **Adversarial plan critique** — catches gaps, risks, and assumptions
- **Domain libraries** — auto-detect from user input (pricing, ads, trust, etc.)
- **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)

**vs. [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) (47K ⭐) and [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (199K ⭐):**

Both frameworks enforce structure for general software engineering. Here's what differentiates this workflow:

| Aspect | [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) | [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | cali-product-workflow |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Stars** | ~47K | ~199K | — |
| **Focus** | Enterprise team simulation (12+ workflows) | TDD-first engineering methodology | Product planning + domain knowledge + execution |
| **Phases** | 4 (Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation) | Skills system (14 skills) | 6 (Setup → Strategic → Shape Up → Interface → Critique → Tech) |
| **Scope Definition** | User stories, epics | Implementation plans | Shape Up with IN/OUT boundaries |
| **Domain Knowledge** | Generic product workflows | Code patterns, best practices | Job To Be Done, Pricing, Trust, Ads, Open Source, Health, Marketplace |
| **Review** | Manual or configured checklists | Subagent quality check | Plannotator visual gate with point-by-point comments |
| **Interface** | 1 UX design workflow (ux-spec.md) | 2-3 text approaches + optional browser | 5 ASCII archetypes + LLM hybrid creation |
| **Testing** | Sprint-based (dev-story + code-review) | TDD-first with subagents | Context-aware: TDD critical paths, mutation targets (70/50/30%), greenfield/brownfield |
| **Execution** | Story-by-story sprint cycle | Batch execution with review checkpoints | Typed scopes with dependency mapping and sequencing |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install pi (if not already)
npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent

# 2. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow.git
cd cali-product-workflow
./install.sh
```

That's it! The installer auto-detects your CLI (pi, opencode, claude-code, codex) and installs everything needed.

See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed options.

---

## 📦 Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer auto-detects your CLI and installs everything needed.

### Two Installation Options

**Option 1: Full Integration (Recommended)**

Installs everything for your detected CLI:

| CLI | What's Installed |
|-----|------------------|
| **Pi** | Core package + Extension + Supporting packages + Skills |
| **OpenCode** | Plugin + Skills |
| **Claude Code** | Plugin + Skills |
| **Codex** | Plugin + Skills |

**Option 2: Skills Only (npx skills)**

For when you want just the skills without full CLI integration:

```bash
npx skills add renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow
```

This installs skills to `~/.agents/skills/` — works across multiple CLIs without deep integration.

**Use this when:**
- You use multiple CLIs and want unified skills
- You don't need plugins/extensions
- You prefer manual control over integration
