**Transform product ideas into approved, testable plans — systematically.**

This package brings [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology to AI coding agents. Instead of open-ended feature lists, you shape proposals with clear scope boundaries, validate them through adversarial critique, and generate typed technical scopes ready for autonomous execution.

---

**Key differentiators:**

- **Product domain libraries** — 8 domains auto-detected from your language (Pricing, Trust, Ads, Promotions, Open Source, Health, Marketplace, Business Models)
- **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan in a visual interface for comments, not just chat
- **Interface exploration** — 5 approaches in ASCII art with flows and trade-offs, then LLM creates hybrid combining best points for the context
- **[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology** — IN/OUT scope boundaries, betting table concepts, aphorisms
- **Typed technical scopes** — feature, spike, optimize, test-* with dependency mapping and sequencing
- **Real-time TUI tracking** — see workflow state as it progresses

*"Measure thrice, cut once"* — applies to product decisions, not just code.

## Philosophy

> *"Let's go slow to go fast: invest time in thorough planning to gain speed and deliver value in execution."*

**Traditional AI development:** "Here's what I want. Start coding."

**With cali-product-workflow:** The user just says:

```
/pw-start "Here's what I want to build"
```

And the workflow begins asking questions, exploring scope, shaping the proposal, reviewing for gaps, getting visual approval, and only then generating typed technical scopes for execution.

## About the Author

**[Cali (Renato Caliari)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calirenato82/)**

This workflow wasn't designed in a vacuum. It comes from years inside real teams — as a product manager, consultant, and leader across different organizations. The skills, patterns, and disciplines here were tested, broken, and rebuilt in live product environments, not conference rooms.

## Why This Exists

**The Problem:** Building products with AI agents often leads to:

- Scope creep and unclear boundaries — defining *what not to build* is harder than *what to build*
- Plans without adversarial review — no one questions assumptions before coding begins
- Technical work before business validation — shipping features that shouldn't exist
- No systematic testing for AI-generated code — AI writes fast, but also writes wrong
- Generic workflows missing product-specific insights — pricing, trust, ads, and launch strategy are product decisions, not code decisions

**The Solution:** A structured workflow that makes AI think like a product manager:

- ✅ **Measure thrice, cut once** — shapes proposals with IN/OUT boundaries BEFORE coding
- ✅ **Strategic exploration** — Job To Be Done, Opportunity Mapping, Evolutionary Principles, Market Analysis, and Product Discovery knowledge integrated
- ✅ **Adversarial critique** — reviews every plan for gaps, risks, and assumptions
- ✅ **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)
- ✅ **Interface exploration in ASCII art** — visualize 5 different approaches in seconds, no coding wasted, then LLM creates a hybrid version combining the best points for the context
- ✅ **Domain libraries** — auto-detects 8 product domains (Pricing, Trust, Ads, etc.) from your language
- ✅ **Technical scope mapping** — breaks down into typed scopes, maps dependencies, sequences execution
- ✅ **AI-aware mutation testing** — for software products, with coverage targets and CI gates
- ✅ **Greenfield & Brownfield** — works for new products and existing product evolution

**Key Features:**

- **21 sub-skills** organized into 4 layers — orchestrator + strategies + workflow stages + tactics
- Part of a broader ecosystem of **54+ skills** for coding, ops, research, and facilitation
- Real-time TUI tracking with visual overlay (`/pw-menu`)
- Gate approval via Plannotator — review, comment, approve or reject before implementation
- Typed scopes for autonomous execution (feature, spike, test-*, optimize)

## How We Differ

This workflow combines product planning, domain knowledge, and technical execution for digital products. Here's how it compares:

| Aspect | Standard Agent | Heavy Framework | cali-product-workflow |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Scope** | Open-ended | Full lifecycle | Shaped proposals with IN/OUT |
| **Review** | Manual chat | Configured | Adversarial critique + Gate |
| **Domain Skills** | None | Generic | 8 product-specific (auto-detected) |
| **Testing** | Ad-hoc | Configured | AI-aware mutation coverage |
| **Interface** | None | Coded mockups | ASCII art + tradeoffs + hybrid |
| **Tracking** | None | Varies | Real-time TUI + visual overlay |

### Key Differences

**vs. Claude Code / OpenCode:**

Both have a "plan" mode, but it's basic — restrict tools and add generic planning instructions. There's no structured product thinking: no scope boundaries, no adversarial critique, no domain-specific playbooks, no visual review gates.

- **Shapes proposals before coding** — with clear IN/OUT boundaries
- **Adversarial plan critique** — catches gaps, risks, and assumptions
- **Domain libraries** — auto-detect from user input (pricing, ads, trust, etc.)
- **Visual review gate** — Plannotator opens the full plan for point-by-point comments (not just chat)

**vs. [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) (47K ⭐) and [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (199K ⭐):**

Both frameworks enforce structure for general software engineering. Here's what differentiates this workflow:

| Aspect | [BMAD Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) | [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | cali-product-workflow |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Stars** | ~47K | ~199K | — |
| **Focus** | Enterprise team simulation (12+ workflows) | TDD-first engineering methodology | Product planning + domain knowledge + execution |
| **Phases** | 4 (Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation) | Skills system (14 skills) | 6 (Setup → Strategic → Shape Up → Interface → Critique → Tech) |
| **Scope Definition** | User stories, epics | Implementation plans | Shape Up with IN/OUT boundaries |
| **Domain Knowledge** | Generic product workflows | Code patterns, best practices | Job To Be Done, Pricing, Trust, Ads, Open Source, Health, Marketplace |
| **Review** | Manual or configured checklists | Subagent quality check | Plannotator visual gate with point-by-point comments |
| **Interface** | 1 UX design workflow (ux-spec.md) | 2-3 text approaches + optional browser | 5 ASCII archetypes + LLM hybrid creation |
| **Testing** | Sprint-based (dev-story + code-review) | TDD-first with subagents | Context-aware: TDD critical paths, mutation targets (70/50/30%), greenfield/brownfield |
| **Execution** | Story-by-story sprint cycle | Batch execution with review checkpoints | Typed scopes with dependency mapping and sequencing |

---

## ❤️ Radical Transparency

This workflow is a tool for **amplifying human judgment**, not a substitute for it.
It forces structure that teams often skip: multi-angle critique, IN/OUT boundaries,
tech sequencing, gap analysis. But the underlying AI still has real limitations you
need to know about.

### What the AI still gets wrong (even with this workflow)

| # | Problem | Evidence | What the workflow tries to do | Why it's not solved (honest assessment) |
|---|---------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Context rot** — compliance with own rules drops from ~73% (turn 5) to ~33% (turn 16) in long sessions | Gamage 2026, 4,416 trials across multiple models | Context rot awareness rules in orchestrator. Fresh context check before execution (reads plan from disk). Execution Critique requires reading artifacts from disk, not memory. Session-knowledge artifacts preserved per session. | **Not solved at all.** The workflow itself is vulnerable — the orchestrator can forget its own rules if the session is long enough. Disk artifacts help, but the LLM still processes them inside a potentially degraded context. Recommended mitigation (fresh session between stages) depends on the user remembering to do it. Context rot is a property of the underlying transformer architecture. You will experience it with this workflow. |
| 2 | **80% Problem** — AI ships the happy path (CRUD, main flow) but omits error handling, observability, security, retry, rollback, edge cases | Osmani Jan 2026, GitClear 2025 (refactored code 22% → 10%, copy/paste 8.3% → 12.3% as AI adoption grows) | Tech Planning requires NFRs per scope. Verification includes an explicit "invisible 20%" checklist (error handling, security, observability, validation). Execution Critique checks NFR coverage as its own criterion. | **Partially mitigated.** Explicit checklists catch some omissions — if the LLM reads them. But the same model that implemented the code also evaluates the checklist. Blind spots transfer. No guarantee the LLM will understand what "retry with exponential backoff" means in your specific domain. Human review of error paths is still the only reliable mitigation. |
| 3 | **Model dependency** — Claude Opus, Gemini Flash, GPT-4o produce significantly different quality. Smaller models miss more. | Veracode 2025 (45% of AI-generated code contains flaws); Anthropic Jan 2026 (AI-assisted devs score 17% lower on comprehension tests) | Every artifact tracks `generated_by: {model_name}` in frontmatter so you know what generated it. Gate stage shows provenance before Plannotator review ("Spec by X, Critique by Y, Interfaces by Z"). | **Transparency, not mitigation.** Knowing the model helps you calibrate expectations, but it doesn't fix the quality gap. If a small model generated your tech plan, the entire execution rests on an unreliable foundation. The workflow cannot compensate for the model you chose. The comprehension penalty (Anthropic 2026) affects users regardless of which model does the work. |
| 4 | **Constraint decay** — the AI progressively violates its own self-imposed rules over time | arXiv 2026 (analysis of agent behavior over long horizons) | Context rot rules explicitly warn about this in the orchestrator. "No patching in degraded context" rule blocks the most common decay pattern. | **Same root cause as context rot.** The warning helps, but stopping a session mid-flow is disruptive and users rarely do it. The workflow's own stage index can drift if a long session handles multiple stages — the LLM might skip steps it already "remembers" doing. |
| 5 | **Code hallucination** — AI invents APIs, functions, or contracts that don't exist (~20% of failures) | arXiv 2024 (large-scale analysis of code generation failures); 20.41% of failures are hallucinated APIs | Verification stage runs the test suite, which catches some hallucinated APIs. Execution Critique includes implementation quality as a criterion. | **Caught by tests, not by the workflow.** If the hallucinated API compiles but has wrong behavior, tests should catch it. If tests don't exist (or are also hallucinated), neither Verification nor Critique detects it. This workflow structures what to build — it cannot verify what the AI built matches reality. |
| 6 | **Shallow review trap** — the same LLM that wrote the code also reviews it. Green tests are not evidence of correctness when the same AI wrote both. | Ox Security "Army of Juniors" 2025 (AI-generated code deployed to production with critical flaws) | Plannotator Gate is independent from execution (separate stage). Verification warns that self-written tests are not evidence of correctness. Mutation testing is recommended in testing-strategy.md. Execution Critique includes "Don't trust the same model" warning. | **Awareness, not prevention.** The workflow can warn you, but it cannot enforce review by a different model or a human. In practice, the same session that executed the code also runs Verification. The Audit Warning "Don't trust the same model" is a recommendation — whether the user follows it is outside workflow control. |
| 7 | **Expertise cliff** — AI fails in mature codebases with implicit conventions, undocumented architecture, organizational knowledge that isn't in any file | Tian Pan Mai 2026; METR 2025 (experienced devs are 19% slower with AI, 0% of AI PRs are mergeable as-is) | The workflow's domain libraries and structured specs help surface some conventions, but they don't replace organizational knowledge. Execution Critique checks for broken refs and anti-patterns. | **Not addressed.** This workflow was designed for greenfield projects or well-documented features. If your codebase has 10 years of undocumented architecture decisions, the AI will violate them regardless of how structured the plan is. The 19% slowdown (METR 2025) applies here too — experienced devs navigating mature codebases with AI may actually be slower. |
| 8 | **Plan staleness** — plans are generated against one snapshot of the codebase; by the time execution starts, the target has changed | Superpowers Issue #989 (open); inherent to any multi-stage pipeline | Each stage re-reads artifacts from disk. Before execution, execution.md requires verifying target files against the plan. Gate stage blocks execution if the plan hasn't been re-approved after changes. | **Helpful structure, no enforcement.** Re-reading from disk is automatic, but the LLM cannot verify staleness unless it reads the actual target files — something that must be explicitly instructed. In practice, plan staleness is caught only when a file doesn't exist or the diff is obviously incompatible. Subtle staleness (renamed functions, refactored modules) passes through. |
| 9 | **Pipeline memory loss** — the pipeline has no cross-session memory of its own failure patterns. The same mistake repeats in every cycle. | Flamehaven 2026 (AI pipeline analysis) | Execution Critique includes a Lessons Learned criterion that gets documented per cycle. The gap registry tracks recurring patterns. | **Captured but not re-applied.** Lessons learned are saved as markdown files — they only help if someone reads them before the next cycle. The workflow has no mechanism to inject past lessons into future sessions. Each session starts fresh, including its capacity to repeat old mistakes. |
| 10 | **Code complexity growth** — AI-generated code tends to increase complexity over time. Static analysis warnings +30%, code complexity +41% after month 2 of sustained AI use. | Cursor longitudinal study; Faros AI 2025 (AI-assisted teams produce 47% more PRs/day but activity ≠ productivity) | Execution Critique includes anti-pattern detection (god functions >100 lines, global mutable state). Verification runs static analysis. | **Caught too late.** Complexity analysis happens after code is written. The workflow has no mechanism to prevent complexity during generation — only flag it after. Preventive measures (code review by a human, architecture boundaries) are outside workflow scope. The 47% more PRs with no productivity gain (Faros AI) suggests velocity metrics can mask regress. |
| 11 | **Activity ≠ productivity** — more PRs, more commits, more tasks completed does not mean more value delivered. AI teams look busy without being effective. | METR 2025 (19% slower for experienced devs, $0.5M‑2M cost/repo for full rollout); Faros AI 2025 (9% more tasks, 47% more PRs, no productivity gain); Stack Overflow 2025 (45% of devs find AI debugging takes longer than expected) | The workflow is designed to reduce activity — shape proposals should be small enough to fit a 6-week appetite. The Execution Critique's decision matrix includes "close without follow-up" as a valid outcome. | **Philosophical tension.** The workflow itself generates activity (artifacts, sessions, gates, critiques). More structure could mean more busywork. The Shape Up appetite constraint is the only guard against this, and it's easy to bypass by making scopes larger than they should be. The 19% slowdown for experienced devs (METR 2025) raises an uncomfortable question: this workflow might add overhead without proportional value for some teams. |

### How to read this table

Each row is honest about what the workflow can and cannot do. We don't claim mitigations
are solutions. Every "What the workflow tries to do" cell has a corresponding "Why it's
not solved" cell. Read both before deciding whether this workflow helps your context.

### What this means for you

- **Every artifact is a draft.** Treat spec-product.md, spec-tech.md, critique reports,
  and interface proposals as first drafts that need human eyes.
- **Results vary by model and codebase.** A small model generating a plan for a mature
  codebase is a recipe for failure — regardless of how structured the workflow is.
- **Human review is required.** The workflow catches structural gaps (missing scopes,
  contradictory requirements, some untested edge cases). It does NOT catch logic errors
  in individual lines, security flaws in business logic, or nuanced architectural
  trade-offs — those need you.
- **None of the 11 problems above are solved by any framework.** Not BMAD (47K⭐), not
  Superpowers (199K⭐), not SpecKit, not GSD. We're transparent about it because the
  limitation is not in any framework — it's in the technology itself.

> We don't claim to solve product planning. We claim to **structure the thinking**
> so you catch more before you code. The rest is still up to you.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This package works across **multiple coding agents** — not just pi.dev. See the compatibility table in [Installation](#-installation) to pick your path.

| Your situation | Recommended command | What you get |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **New to CLIs** (no Node, no agent) | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../setup.sh \| sh` | Node.js + pi.dev + all extensions + 20 skills |
| **Already use pi.dev** | `git clone ... && ./install.sh` | 20 skills + TUI overlay + slash commands |
| **Use OpenCode / Claude Code / Codex** | `git clone ... && ./install.sh` | 20 skills + command files (no TUI) |
| **Any CLI (skills only)** | `npx skills add renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow -g` | 20 skills via DotAgents Protocol |

See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed options.
Per-agent configuration files (commands, install scripts) are in [`cli-agents/`](cli-agents/).

## 📦 Installation

### CLI Compatibility

Not every feature works on every CLI. Here's what to expect:

| Feature | pi.dev | OpenCode | Claude Code | Codex |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Skills (all 20)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **`/pw-start`, `/pw-menu` commands** | ✅ Slash commands | ✅ Via `pw-*.md` files | ✅ Via command files | ✅ Via command files |
| **TUI overlay (real-time status)** | ✅ Native | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Plannotator visual gate** | ✅ Extension | ⚠️ Manual | ⚠️ Manual | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Deep hooks (events, gates)** | ✅ Extension | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> **Bottom line:** The **20 skills work identically on every CLI** — they run the full Shape Up workflow, generate plans, critique, scopes, everything. The TUI overlay and deep integration features are Pi-only because only Pi exposes an extension system. All CLIs can still complete the workflow; it just happens in chat rather than a visual panel.

---

### 🚀 Path A: From Zero (pi.dev + Everything)

**One command, everything included.** Pick this if you don't have pi.dev yet.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow/main/setup.sh | sh
```

**What gets installed:**

| Component | Details | Works on |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Node.js** | v20+ (if not installed) | — |
| **pi.dev** | Latest version | pi.dev |
| **Extensions (22)** | subagents, browser, intercom, supervisor, plannotator, etc. | pi.dev only |
| **Skills (20)** | Shape Up, JTBD, Pricing, Ads, Discovery, and more | **All CLIs** ✅ |
| **Settings** | Theme, model defaults, skill shortcuts | pi.dev |

> **Not using pi.dev?** The skills are still installed to `~/.agents/skills/` — they work on OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex too. You just won't get the Pi-only extensions or TUI. The workflow itself runs fine.

### 📋 Path B: Existing pi.dev User

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow.git
cd cali-product-workflow
./install.sh
```

The installer auto-detects your CLIs and installs skills + extensions + slash commands. Skills go to `~/.agents/skills/`.

### 📋 Path C: Other CLI (OpenCode / Claude Code / Codex)

The **skills** are the core of this project — they work on **any** agent that supports the [DotAgents Protocol](https://dotagents.org).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow.git
cd cali-product-workflow
./install.sh
```

The installer detects your CLI and installs **skills + command files**. No extensions, no TUI — just the 20 skills that run the workflow.

**Or, with npx (no clone needed):**

```bash
npx skills add renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow -g
```

This installs all 20 skills to `~/.agents/skills/` — works on any CLI.

> For CLI-specific setup (OpenCode config, Claude Code plugin, Codex plugin), see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

</details>

### Updates

How each CLI stays current with the cali-product-workflow:

| CLI | Update mechanism | Auto? | What updates |
|-----|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Pi** | `pi update` or `pi update --extensions` | ✅ Manual (`pi update`) | Core package (git clone), supporting npm packages |
| **OpenCode** | `npx skills update` | ❌ Manual | Skills only |
| **Claude Code** | `claude plugin update name@marketplace` | ❌ Manual | Plugin + skills |
| **Codex** | `codex plugin marketplace upgrade` | ❌ Manual | Plugin + skills |

**Pi note:** Since the core package is installed via `git:` without a ref pin, `pi update` pulls the latest commit from the default branch. Supporting npm packages are also updated.

**Skills:** `npx skills update` checks GitHub for changes and reinstalls if needed. Run it occasionally to keep skills current across all CLIs.

**Pro tip:** Run `./install.sh update` — it runs `npx skills update` and verifies all skill directories are present.

### Why Git-Based (No npm)

This project distributes **exclusively via GitHub** — no npm publishing. This is a deliberate security choice:

| Risk | npm packages | Git-based (this project) |
|------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Supply chain worms** (Shai-Hulud) | ❌ Worm self-propagates via stolen npm tokens | ✅ No npm token to steal |
| **`preinstall` code execution** | ❌ Scripts run automatically on install | ✅ Only markdown + assets copied |
| **Registry compromise** | ❌ Single centralized registry | ✅ GitHub distributed, auditable |
| **Account takeover blast radius** | ❌ npm token publishes many packages | ✅ Only your repo, no self-propagation |
| **Dependency confusion** | ❌ Possible if public name conflicts | ✅ Impossible — GitHub only source |
| **Maintainer compromise** | ⚠️ Attacker publishes malicious version | ⚠️ **Same risk** — attacker pushes malicious commit |
| **Third-party npm deps** (pi-subagents, etc.) | ⚠️ Subject to all npm risks above | ⚠️ **Same risk** — installed via npm regardless |

**Tradeoff:** Without npm, CLIs that rely on npm for JS plugins (e.g., OpenCode) are limited to skills. Deep integrations (hooks, TUI, slash commands) work only on Pi, which supports native Git install via `pi install git:...`.

**Bottom line:** Git-based distribution solves the risks we *control* (how we ship our code). Risks we *inherit* (maintainer compromise, third-party deps) are shared with all software — managed through defense in depth, not eliminated.

### Third-Party Dependency Management

Third-party npm dependencies exist **only for Pi**. OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex use only skills (markdown files) — our code is never distributed via npm. (The `npx skills` CLI itself is an npm package, but it's a well-audited Vercel tool used to fetch markdown from GitHub — not our runtime.)

For protection against supply chain risks (for Pi's npm deps and general development), see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

Pi requires these npm packages for deep integration (slash commands, TUI, event hooks):

| Package | Purpose | Can use `git:`? |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `pi-subagents` | Parallel agent orchestration | ✅ `git:github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents` |
| `@capyup/pi-goal` | Goal management with status overlay | ✅ `git:github.com/Michaelliv/pi-goal` |
| `pi-intercom` | Session coordination | ✅ `git:github.com/nicobailon/pi-intercom` |
| `pi-supervisor` | Conversation supervision | ✅ `git:github.com/tintinweb/pi-supervisor` |
| `pi-autoresearch` | Autonomous research | ✅ `git:github.com/davebcn87/pi-autoresearch` |
| `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question` | User prompts | ✅ `git:github.com/juicesharp/rpiv-mono` |
| `@plannotator/pi-extension` | Visual plan review | ✅ `git:github.com/backnotprop/plannotator` |

Switching from `npm:` to `git:` does not change the security profile — the code is identical. The effective mitigation is defense in depth, not replacing the registry channel.

**Our distribution model (GitHub, no self-publish) and our dependency model (npm for Pi packages) address different risk layers** — a distinction recognized by:

- **[OWASP Dependency Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)** — Open Web Application Security Project standard for identifying known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **[NIST SSDF](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf)** — US National Institute of Standards and Technology's Secure Software Development Framework, which separates producer/distributor controls from consumer/dependency controls
- **[ENISA Supply Chain Guidance](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/supply-chain-guidelines)** — European Union Agency for Cybersecurity guidelines distinguishing first-party distribution integrity from third-party dependency risk

**How we handle it today:**

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Regular `pi update` | ✅ Already documented | `pi update --extensions` keeps all packages current |
| Pi's built-in lockfile | ✅ Already happens | Pi runs `npm install` internally, which generates and respects lockfiles |

**On pinning:** Not recommended for actively maintained packages. A 2026 study ([Pinning Is Futile, arXiv 2502.06662](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06662)) found that pinning *increases* vulnerability exposure — pinned packages go stale because teams forget to update them. For packages with weekly releases (e.g., `pi-subagents` with 77 versions), **staying current via `pi update` is safer than pinning**.

**Skill-only mode (avoid npm entirely):** Set `INSTALL_SKILLS_ONLY=1` to skip all npm package installation:

```bash
INSTALL_SKILLS_ONLY=1 ./install.sh
```

This applies only to **Pi** — the other CLIs (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex) already have zero npm dependencies. In this mode, Pi loses slash commands and TUI overlay, but the `cali-product-workflow` skill still works normally.

**For development dependencies (TypeScript, Vitest, Stryker):** We use `.npmrc` with `save-exact=true` to keep our own toolchain deterministic.

**Recommended for users:** See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for a guide on supply chain security tools (Socket.dev + Snyk) and how to set them up.

### Agent Instructions Setup

The installer **does not modify** your AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md automatically. This is intentional:

- **Safety:** Auto-modifying agent instructions can break existing workflows. Your agent config is yours.
- **Idempotence:** No cleanup needed on uninstall — no traces left behind.
- **Awareness:** You should consciously review what instructions your agent follows.
- **Portability:** Different agents use different files (`AGENTS.md` vs `CLAUDE.md`). You decide what fits.

After installation, manually add this to your agent's instructions file:

## cali-product-workflow Integration

When working on software projects, trigger the product workflow:

1. **Trigger:** Use `/skill cali-product-workflow`
3. **Execute:** Only after visual review gate (Plannotator approval)
````

| CLI | File |
|-----|------|
| **Pi** | `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` |
| **OpenCode** | `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` or project `AGENTS.md` |
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or project `CLAUDE.md` |
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` or project `AGENTS.md` |

## 📁 Artifact Directory

All workflow artifacts are stored in:

```
<project>/.pi/workflow/
```

| Subdirectory | Contents |
|--------------|----------|
| `input/` | User's original idea |
| `stages/` | Stage outputs (JTBD, Shape Up, Interface, etc.) |
| `plans/` | Technical plans and specs |
| `reviews/` | Plannotator feedback |
| `scopes/` | Typed execution scopes |
| `logs/` | Workflow execution logs |

---

## 🔄 Process

The workflow runs through six phases:

1. **Setup** — User provides initial idea, AI asks clarifying questions
2. **Strategic** — Job To Be Done, Opportunity Mapping, Evolutionary Principles, Market Analysis, Product Discovery
3. **Shape Up** — Appetite, Hill Chart, Rabbit Holes, distant future, enemies, solutions, scope boundaries (IN/OUT), betting table
4. **Interface** — ASCII art exploration, trade-offs, LLM hybrid creation
5. **Critique** — Adversarial review, gaps, risks, assumptions
6. **Tech Planning** — Typed scopes (feature, spike, optimize, test-*), dependency mapping, sequencing
