 * IMPORTANT: this test exists because of the bug where the herdr plugin
 * returned false for `cwd_matches("", project)`, hiding workflows whose
 * `cwd` field was never written by the extension. The fix was to mirror
 * muxy's `isWorkflowCwdCompatible` exactly — no early return on empty.
 *
 * If you change one of these functions, change the other.
