## Recommended Flow

For a complete JTBD analysis, follow this logical sequence:

```
1. Contextual Segmentation      → define the market
   ↓
2. Thinking Styles              → segment by cognition/behavior
   ↓
3. JTBD Discovery               → define the jobs
   ↓
4. Job Actors                   → identify who is involved
   ↓
5. Situational Variables        → understand the context
   ↓
6. Job Map Steps                → map the journey
   ↓
7. Functional Needs             → success criteria
   ↓
8. Financial Needs              → financial criteria
   ↓
9. Emotional & Social Jobs      → human dimension
   ↓
10. Competitor Discovery        → who else solves the job
```

## Interaction Tool Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When the user needs to choose between predefined options, ALWAYS use the `question` tool (if available) with enumerated format:
- Options with short `label` and `description`
- Examples: prompt selection (1-10), analysis type, next steps, etc.

When `question` tool is not available, use enumerated text in chat (A/B/C/D or 1/2/3).

---

## General Instructions for the Agent

- **Ask which prompt the user wants to run** (unless already clear from context):
  - Use `question` tool with options 1-10 for the 10 JTBD prompts
  - Always include option: "I want you to recommend based on context" (in the user's language)
  - Fallback: "Qual análise JTBD você quer realizar? (1-10, ou 'recomende com base no contexto')"
- **Fill in the variables** indicated by `[brackets]` or `{{braces}}` with the information provided by the user before executing the prompt.
- **Chain prompts sequentially** when the user wants a full analysis — the output of one prompt feeds into the next (e.g., Situational Variables → Functional Needs).
- **Language of output**: The prompts are written in English (instructions to the LLM), but results should be delivered in the language used by the user.
- Read the appropriate file from `references/` before executing a prompt.
