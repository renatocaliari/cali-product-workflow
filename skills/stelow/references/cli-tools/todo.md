# Todo Management

> Unified to-do pattern for cross-CLI phase task tracking. All skills MUST reference this file — never call todo tools directly.

## Quick Summary

Create, update, and track stage-specific tasks with consistent naming. Stage prefix ensures user always knows which stage they're in.

## Todo Naming Convention

```
[PREFIX]-[N] Task description in imperative English

Format: [PREFIX] = phase name (uppercase), [N] = sequential number starting at 1
Examples:
  [SETUP-1] Verify workflow directory structure
  [SHAPE-1] Define problem statement and solution
  [SHAPE-2] Create Appetite (time budget)
  [EXEC-3] Implement authentication feature scope
```

## Status Indicators

| Status | Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| completed | `✓` | Task finished successfully |
| in_progress | `◐` | Currently being worked on |
| pending | `○` | Not yet started |

---

## Lifecycle

### Phase Todos

1. **Create** — When entering a phase, LLM creates todos from phase template
2. **Update** — User marks tasks complete; LLM updates status
3. **Sync** — Every turn end, todos sync from memory cache to `phase-todos.json`
4. **Resume** — On session start, todos loaded from `phase-todos.json` to memory cache
5. **Clear** — When phase completes, todos reset for next phase

### Inbox Items

1. **Add** — User says "defer this"; item added to end of `inbox/items.md`
2. **Read** — LLM reads inbox when user asks to review deferred items
3. **Dedupe** — If item is already in workflow, remove from inbox
4. **Execute** — When user picks item from inbox, it enters workflow

### File Sync Strategy

```
Memory Cache ←→ phase-todos.json
     ↑                  ↑
     └── onTurnEnd ─────┘
     ↑                  ↑
     └── onResume ──────┘
```

- **Memory cache** = source of truth during session
- **File** = persistence across sessions/CLIs
- **Write policy** = every turn end
- **Read policy** = session start (workflow detected)

---

## Source of Truth

All CLIs MUST write phase todos to file for cross-CLI persistence:

```
.stelow/{date}/{dir}/phase-todos.json
```

| CLI | Tool | Persistence | Strategy |
|-----|------|-------------|----------|
| Pi + rpiv-todo | `todo` | ✅ Branch replay | Use tool + write to file |
| Claude Code | `TodoWrite` | ❌ Session only | Write to file, read on resume |
| OpenCode | `TodoWrite` | ❌ Session only | Write to file, read on resume |
| Codex | None | N/A | File-based only |

CLI native todos are for **DISPLAY**. File is always the source of truth.

**On session resume:** Read phase-todos.json, reconstruct todo list, display.

---

## CLI Commands

### pi (with rpiv-todo)

**Tool:** `todo` (via `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo` extension)

> **Required:** Install with `pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-todo`

rpiv-todo persists tasks via branch replay — survives `/reload` and conversation compaction.

For cross-CLI compatibility, ALWAYS write phase todos to file (see "Source of Truth" section).


```typescript
todo({ action: "create", subject: "[PHASE-1] Task", description: "..." })
todo({ action: "update", id: todoId, status: "completed" })
todo({ action: "list" })
```

### claude-code

**Tool:** `TodoWrite`

```typescript
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "[PHASE-1] Task description",
      activeForm: "Executing [PHASE-1] Task description",
      status: "in_progress"  // pending | in_progress | completed
    }
  ]
})

// Replace entire list on each update
TodoWrite({ todos: updatedArray })
```

### opencode

**Tool:** `TodoWrite` (same schema as Claude Code)

```typescript
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "[PHASE-1] Task description",
      activeForm: "Executing [PHASE-1] Task description",
      status: "pending"
    }
  ]
})
```

### codex

**Tool:** No native todo tool. Use file-based tracking:

```typescript
// Write todo state to file
write({
  path: ".stelow/{date}/{dir}/phase-todos.json",
  content: JSON.stringify({
    phase: "SHAPE",
    phaseIndex: 3,
    todos: [
      { id: "SHAPE-1", content: "...", status: "completed" },
      { id: "SHAPE-2", content: "...", status: "in_progress" }
    ]
  }, null, 2)
})

// Read on session start to restore context
read({ path: ".stelow/{date}/{dir}/phase-todos.json" })
```

### generic (Fallback)

When no native todo tool is available, track tasks in the response:

```
## Current Phase Tasks: SHAPE (Phase 4/15)

✓ [SHAPE-1] Define problem statement
◐ [SHAPE-2] Create Appetite (time budget)
○ [SHAPE-3] Define IN scope boundaries
○ [SHAPE-4] Define OUT scope boundaries
---

## Inbox Format

The inbox (`.stelow/inbox/items.md`) stores items deferred by the user.


```markdown
# Inbox

Implement dark mode
Fix login race condition
Refactor auth module
Add AI summarization
```

**Format:** One item per line. No type, no date, no metadata needed.
- Type is deduced by LLM when reading
- Date can be obtained from git blame if needed
- If more context is needed, the LLM asks the user

**Empty inbox:**
```markdown
# Inbox

```

**Rules:**
- Skip empty lines
- Skip the `# Inbox` header line
- Everything else is an item title

---
○ [SHAPE-5] Write solution approach
```

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Every response**: Start with phase indicator, show todo list
2. **Before calling todo tool**: Read current workflow state from tracking file
3. **After phase completion**: Auto-advance to next stage. `/sw-next` only needed if workflow was paused or halted by error.
4. **On session resume**: Reconstruct todo list from current phase tracking data
5. **Never mix phases**: Each todo set belongs to one phase only
6. **File persistence**: Always write todos to `phase-todos.json` (see Source of Truth)
7. **CLI todos are display only**: They may be lost on session end — file is always truth

---

## Phase-Todos.json Format

```json
{
  "workflow": "workflow-name",
  "phase": "SHAPE",
  "phaseIndex": 3,
  "todos": [
    { "id": "SHAPE-1", "content": "Define problem statement", "status": "completed" },
    { "id": "SHAPE-2", "content": "Create Appetite", "status": "in_progress" },
    { "id": "SHAPE-3", "content": "Define IN scope", "status": "pending" }
  ],
  "updatedAt": "2026-05-24T10:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Fallback (Generic)

When no native todo tool is available in the current CLI:

1. Track todos as markdown in response
2. Persist to `.stelow/{date}/{dir}/phase-todos.json`
3. Read on session resume to reconstruct context
4. User sees todos in chat, not in sidebar
