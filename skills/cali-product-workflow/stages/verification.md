## Verification

> **Part of cali-product-workflow** — See [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) for stage sequence, safety rules, and capability reference.
> **Tool Restrictions:** See `stages.yaml` for blocked/allowed tools in this stage.

After all scopes are executed, run the full testing protocol before delivery audit.

### Auto-chain

Verification runs **automatically after Execution** once all scopes complete.
After Verification passes, automatically proceed to Execution Critique.

### test-suite

Run the project's test suite:

```bash
# Go
go test ./...

# Node
npm test

# Python
pytest
```

**Block until tests pass.** Do not proceed with failing tests.

### code-review (if 3+ files)

If the diff touches 3+ files, launch fresh-context reviewers in parallel.
See `references/cli-tools/subagents.md` for the `subagent()` pattern — this works
on pi.dev, OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex (all have native subagent support).
Run **automatically** with `context: "fresh"` — the fresh session provides
independent review without the degraded context of the original session.
This mitigates the shallow review trap (Ox Security 2025) even with the
same model, because the issue isn't identical models but contaminated context
(Gamage 2026 "Omission Constraints Decay").

### ui-quality (if visual)

If the scope involves a visual interface, use a **two-tier approach**.
The Quick Tier (browserless) catches ~80% of issues from source code alone.
The Full Tier (agent-browser) catches the remaining ~20% that require a
live browser.

See `references/cli-tools/agent_browser.md` for browser automation details.

#### Quick Tier — Source Code Analysis (browserless, ~80% coverage)

Analyze the component source code and styles directly. This catches most
accessibility and design issues without the cost of a live browser.

Use the `subagent()` pattern from
[`subagents.md`](references/cli-tools/subagents.md) with `context: "fresh"`
and a reviewer task covering:
- Accessibility from source: ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, alt text,
  form labels, keyboard event handlers, focus management, color contrast
  via CSS tokens, heading hierarchy
- Design from source: cognitive load, visual hierarchy, AI slop detection
  (generic text, icon-only buttons without labels)
- Report what CAN be verified from source and flag what needs a live browser

**Research basis:** AccessGuru (arXiv 2025) shows LLMs achieve ~84%
violation score decrease analyzing HTML source — no browser needed for
syntactic accessibility violations. Deque (2026) confirms ~40% of WCAG
issues are auto-detectable; LLMs push this further by evaluating semantic
correctness (e.g., "is this alt text meaningful?") that rule-based tools
cannot assess.

#### Full Tier — Browser Verification (agent-browser, remaining ~20%)

**Only run if:**
1. Quick Tier flagged issues that need a live browser to confirm
2. The feature has complex CSS (animations, transitions, responsive)
3. Screen reader behavior needs verification
4. Visual regression is a concern

Use `agent_browser` per `references/cli-tools/agent_browser.md`:
- Open the component/feature in the browser
- Snapshot interactive elements
- Verify color contrast (rendered, not computed)
- Check hover/focus/active states
- Test keyboard navigation end-to-end
- Test with viewport resizing

Take screenshots for evidence. Compare against the Quick Tier findings.

### interactive-testing (if interactive)

If the feature has interactive elements (forms, clicks, inputs):

#### Quick Tier — Logic Audit (browserless)

Review the interaction logic from source code:
- Form validation: required fields, input types, error messages
- Loading/error/empty states: are all states rendered?
- Event handlers: correct targets, proper cleanup (useEffect return)
- State management: optimistic updates, rollback on error
- API call patterns: correct endpoints, error handling, retry?

#### Full Tier — Browser Testing (agent-browser)

**Run if:** the interaction involves complex UI state (modals, drag-and-drop,
multi-step forms) or the Quick Tier found issues that need live verification.

See `references/cli-tools/agent_browser.md` for browser automation details.
Use `dogfood` skill for structured exploratory testing:
1. Open the feature in browser
2. Test happy path
3. Test error states
4. Test edge cases (empty states, loading, errors)
5. Capture screenshots for evidence

### final-checklist

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Code review done (subagent or human)
- [ ] No regressions detected
- [ ] UI accessible (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated (if architecture changed)

### code-quality-gate

Run static analysis appropriate to the project's language. This is language-
agnostic — adapt to your tech stack (not just eslint/tsc):

```bash
# Go
go vet ./... 2>&1 | head -20

# Node/TypeScript (if package.json exists)
npm run lint 2>&1 | head -20
# or
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20

# Python (if requirements.txt or pyproject.toml exists)
ruff check . 2>&1 | head -20
# or
pylint src/ 2>&1 | head -20

# Rust (if Cargo.toml exists)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings 2>&1 | head -20
```

**Block on errors** (not warnings) — warnings are informational and should be
reviewed but are not blockers. Address all errors before proceeding.

### invisible-20-percent

For each file changed in the diff, check:

| Dimension | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| **Error handling** | Retry/backoff implemented? Fallback defined? |
| **Observability** | Structured logging? Correlation IDs? |
| **Security** | Auth consistent across all endpoints? Input sanitization? Rate limiting? |
| **Validation** | Null/empty/boundary handling? |
| **Rollback** | Rollback strategy documented? Migration has reversal? |

This exists because LLMs tend to implement the happy path (80%) and omit
the "invisible 20%" (Osmani 2026, GitClear 2025).

### auto-proceed

After all verification steps pass, **automatically proceed to Execution Critique**.

> **Note on browser dependency:** The Quick Tier (browserless) in

> (agent-browser) is pi.dev only per
> [agent_browser.md](references/cli-tools/agent_browser.md). Other CLIs should
