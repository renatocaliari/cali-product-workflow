## Strategic Context (optional)

> **Part of cali-product-workflow** — See [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) for stage sequence, safety rules, and capability reference.
> **Tool Restrictions:** See `stages.yaml` for blocked/allowed tools in this stage.

**After Setup**, the flow enters Strategic Context to enrich planning with optional context.
The LLM checks if the user should be offered strategic analysis and/or domain libraries.

### context:10 — Strategic Exploration (always ask)

**ALWAYS ask** — use **Pattern 1** from `stages/ask-patterns.md` for the question format.
**ALSO read** the "Strategic Approaches" table in the main `SKILL.md` for the full approach list with skill names and outputs.

> **⚠️ Multi-Select Rule:** When using `multiSelect: true`, DO NOT include "None", "Skip", or similar meta-options. User can select nothing to skip.

**If user selects one or more approaches:**
1. Read `references/strategic-exploration.md` for each approach's details
2. Execute the selected ones **in parallel** using the subagents tool (see `references/cli-tools/subagents.md`):
3. Consolidate into `strategic-insights.md`
4. Incorporate outputs as Shape Up input

**If nothing selected (No strategic analysis):** proceed directly to Domain Context Detection (2b).

### context:20 — Domain Context Detection (conditional)

**After Strategic Exploration (2a)**, the LLM analyzes the user's original request for **domain signals**:

| User Input Signal | Domain | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| "price", "pricing", "how much to charge", "subscription" | Pricing | `cali-product-pricing` |
| "launch", "promotion", "black friday", "coupon", "discount" | Promotions | `cali-product-promotions` |
| "ad", "ads", "facebook ads", "google ads", "paid traffic" | Ads | `cali-product-ads` |
| "trust", "guarantee", "social proof", "credibility" | Trust | `cali-product-trust-building` |
| "business model", "revenue", "monetize", "make money" | Business Models | `cali-product-business-models` |
| "open source", "community edition" | Open Source | `cali-product-open-source` |
| "product health", "product metrics", "addiction", "wellbeing" | Health | `cali-product-health` |
| "marketplace", "marketplace supply", "marketplace demand" | Marketplace | `cali-product-marketplace-playbook` |

**Two detection modes:**

**Mode A — Purely domain-specific request** (user asks only about a domain topic):
The user's request is exclusively about one of these domains (e.g., "help me define a pricing strategy").
→ Route directly to the detected skill. Do NOT proceed to Shape Up.
→ The user can always choose to continue to Shape Up afterwards.

**Mode B — General product request with domain overlap** (user asks for product planning but mentions domains):
The user wants full product planning but the input also contains domain signals.
→ Offer domain libraries as **complementary context** using the ask tool (see `references/cli-tools/structured-question.md`), referencing patterns from `stages/ask-patterns.md`:

```
ask tool: multiSelect question with detected domain options
```
})
```

**If user selects libraries:**
1. Load the selected skill(s) content as additional context
2. Proceed to Shape Up with domain context enriched

**If nothing detected or user declines:** proceed directly to Shape Up or end.
