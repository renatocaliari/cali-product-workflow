# Output Structure

## 1. 🎯 Executive Summary

2-3 sentences summarizing overall plan health, coverage of each checklist,
and most critical gaps.

Format:
```
**Flow coverage:** X/6 — Brief summary of what's missing
**State coverage:** X/7 — Brief summary of what's missing
... (per checklist)
**Overall verdict:** The plan is [solid / has gaps / incomplete]
```

## 2. 🚨 Critical Gaps (Blocking)

Gaps that would **block implementation** — missing essential definitions,
undefined flows, or unhandled states.

Must be resolved before the review gate.

Format for each gap:
- **[tag]** Gap title `(severity)`
  - **What:** Description of what was observed vs what's required
  - **Flagged by:** Which checklist item flagged it
  - **Recommendation:** Specific, actionable question the team needs to answer
  - **Resolved:** Yes (by [rule]) | No

Tags: `[flow]`, `[state]`, `[affordance]`, `[data]`, `[system]`, `[feasibility]`

## 3. 🤔 Important Gaps (Refinement)

Gaps that would cause **significant difficulty** — unclear branching paths,
missing states, undefined error handling.

Should be resolved before the review gate.

Same format as Critical Gaps.

## 4. 🔎 Minor Clarifications

Lower-impact items — polish, edge cases, nice-to-haves.

Same format as Critical Gaps.

## 5. ✅ Strengths

3-5 bullet points highlighting what is particularly well-defined in the plan.
This prevents the critique from feeling purely negative.
