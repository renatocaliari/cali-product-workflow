description: Conduct deep, structured market analysis using multiple methodologies (PESTLE, Foresight, Delphi, Wardley Maps). Use this skill whenever the user asks for market analysis, competitive intelligence, industry research, market trends, weekly intelligence reports, or strategic market insights. Also trigger when the user mentions PESTLE, Wardley Maps, Foresight signals, or wants to understand a market, niche, or industry in depth — even if they don't explicitly ask for "market analysis".

# Multi-Method Market Analysis

A skill for producing rigorous, structured market analysis using multiple complementary methodologies. Two prompt variants are available depending on the user's goal.

---

## Interaction Tool Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: When the user needs to choose between predefined options, ALWAYS use the `question` tool (if available) with enumerated format:
- Options with short `label` and `description`
- Examples: variant selection (General Deep/Weekly Intelligence), topic confirmation, geographic focus, etc.

When `question` tool is not available, use enumerated text in chat (A/B/C/D or 1/2/3).

---

## When to Use Each Variant

- **General Deep Analysis**: For broad, timeless strategic studies of a topic, market, or industry over time horizons (past → present → future 5 years).
- **Weekly Intelligence Canvas**: For fast-moving, 7-day competitive intelligence reports. Works best with real-time search tools (e.g., Grok, Perplexity, or Claude with web search).

---

## Variant 1: General Deep Market Analysis

Use this when the user wants a comprehensive, methodologically rigorous study of a topic across time.

### Prompt Template

```
Study Topic: [FILL IN]
Focus on: [Enter 'Global' or the specific country/region name here]

Goal: Conduct a DEEP market analysis of the study topic.
Cover [Focus on] insights in English.

Methodologies: Use the following methodologies with in-depth details:
- PESTLE
- Foresight (Weak and Strong Signals)
- Delphi
- Wardley Maps

Organize the analysis into:
- Recent Past (1 year ago)
- Current Trends (Today to 1 year)
- Future Predictions (Next 5 years)
```

### How to Apply

1. **Ask the user for their inputs** (if not already provided):
   - Use `question` tool to confirm:
     - **Variant**: "General Deep Analysis" (broad strategic study) or "Weekly Intelligence Canvas" (7-day competitive intelligence)
     - **Study Topic**: The market, industry, or topic to analyze
     - **Geographic Focus**: "Global" or specific country/region
   - Always include option: "I want you to recommend based on context"
   - Fallback (no question tool): "What would you like to analyze? (variant: General Deep or Weekly Intelligence, topic: [your topic], focus: Global or [region])"

2. Apply all four methodologies to each time horizon.
3. Synthesize findings into a coherent narrative, not just isolated frameworks.
