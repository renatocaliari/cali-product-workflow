# Pi CLI — cali-product-workflow

This directory follows the standard `cli-agents/` pattern for all CLI harnesses.
All commands are documented in `COMMANDS.md` (single source of truth).

## Installation

```bash
# Run from project root
./install.sh --cli pi
```

The install script:
- Builds the Pi extension (`extensions/cali-pw-pi/`)
- Installs the extension to Pi
- Installs required npm packages (`pi-subagents`, `pi-intercom`, etc.)
- Installs all 25 skills to `~/.agents/skills/`
- Cleans up any conflicting local Pi skill copies

|---------|-------------|
| `/pw-start` | Start a new workflow |
