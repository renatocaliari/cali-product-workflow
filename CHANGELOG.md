# Changelog

All notable changes to `@renatocaliari/cali-product-workflow` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.2-alpha] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **Cross-skill references**: Replaced `skills/cali-product-*/SKILL.md` paths with skill names (e.g., `cali-product-shape-up`) across orchestrator, stages, tech-planning, scope-executor, and all 25 goals.md files — skills now work standalone at `~/.agents/skills/`
- **Broken ask.md reference**: Fixed 4 references to non-existent `ask.md` → `structured-question.md` in shape-up/SKILL.md and workflow/SKILL.md
- **permissions.md paths**: Removed repo-relative prefixes for standalone compatibility

### Added

- **README standalone note**: Documented that each skill is fully self-contained with its own references/
- **Structured exports**: Added exports field for cleaner imports

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **cali-product-execution-critique skill**: Unified post-implementation audit with 8 fixed criteria across 4 input modes (workflow, plan, context, standalone) and `sem diff` integration for entity-level analysis
- **Radical transparency section** in README: Documents 11 known LLM failure modes per 2026 research (Gamage, Osmani, GitClear, Veracode, Ox Security, METR, Faros AI)
- **Context rot awareness rules** in orchestrator SKILL.md: fresh context between stages, no patching in degraded context, read from disk
- **Fresh context check** in execution stage: re-read spec-tech from disk before starting
- **Invisible 20% checklist** in verification stage: error handling, observability, security, validation, rollback
- **NFR checklist** in tech planning scopes: per-scope non-functional requirements to combat the 80% Problem
- **Model provenance tracking**: `generated_by` in spec-product.md frontmatter + Model Provenance Check in gate stage

### Changed

- Renamed `cali-product-delivery-audit` → `cali-product-execution-critique` (directory, frontmatter, all internal references)
- Merged `cali-post-execution-check` content (triggers, warnings) into `cali-product-execution-critique` skill
- All internal skill references normalized to `skills/*/SKILL.md` pattern
- `setup.sh` and `install.sh` now list 22 skills (added `cali-product-execution-critique`)

### Fixed

- Plannotator description updated to reflect interactive annotation + feedback loop
- 3 stale `cali-product-plan-critique` references in test files → `cali-product-critique`
- DISPLAY_NAMES in phase-consistency test: `Plan Critique` → `Product Critique`
- Stage file name `delivery-audit.md` → `execution-critique.md`
- Core stage files list in sandbox-install test updated

### Removed

- Deprecated `~/.agents/skills/cali-post-execution-check/` (content merged into `cali-product-execution-critique`)

---
  - `.` → main extension entry point
  - `./skills` → skills directory
  - `./extensions` → extensions directory

- **`files` field**: Explicit list of published files for cleaner npm package
  - Only includes necessary files (extensions, skills, scripts, config)
  - Excludes empty directories and development artifacts

### Changed

- **Multi-CLI support**: Package now installs on any CLI (pi, opencode, claude-code, codex)
  - Removed `pi:` field from package.json
  - Moved Pi-specific peerDependencies to `optionalPeerDependencies`
  - Updated description to reflect multi-CLI support
  - Removed "pi-package" from keywords

### Documentation

  - Planning (Fase 5)
  - Execution (Fase 6)

- **Cross-project state**:

  - Global tracking in home directory
  - Auto-discover workflows when opening projects
